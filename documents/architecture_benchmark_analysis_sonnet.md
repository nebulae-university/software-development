## Architecture Pattern Definitions

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
**Definition:** Isolates business logic from external systems through well-defined ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations), creating a symmetric architecture where all external dependencies are pluggable.

**Principles:**
- Business logic is isolated from infrastructure concerns
- External systems interact through defined ports
- Adapters implement the technical details
- Symmetric treatment of user interfaces and technical interfaces

**Advantages:** Technology independence, testability, clear separation of concerns  
**Disadvantages:** Increased abstraction complexity, potential over-engineering

### Clean Architecture
**Definition:** Concentric layer architecture where dependencies point inward toward the business rules, with entities at the center surrounded by use cases, interface adapters, and frameworks.

**Principles:**
- Dependency inversion (dependencies point inward)
- Framework and database independence
- Testable business rules
- Clear layer separation

**Advantages:** Framework independence, testability, maintainability  
**Disadvantages:** Learning curve, potential performance overhead

### Onion Architecture
**Definition:** Layered architecture with domain model at the center, wrapped by domain services, application services, and finally infrastructure, emphasizing domain-driven design principles.

**Principles:**
- Domain model at the center
- All dependencies point toward the domain
- Infrastructure is in the outer layer
- Domain logic is independent of technical concerns

**Advantages:** Domain focus, maintainability, technology independence  
**Disadvantages:** Complexity in simple scenarios, abstraction overhead

### Microsoft® Application Architecture Guide
**Definition:** Comprehensive guidance for enterprise applications covering microservices, domain-driven design, CQRS, event sourcing, and cloud-native patterns.

**Principles:**
- Service-oriented architecture
- Domain-driven design implementation
- CQRS and Event Sourcing for complex domains
- Cross-cutting concerns (security, logging, monitoring)
- Cloud-native deployment patterns

**Advantages:** Enterprise scalability, proven patterns, technology flexibility  
**Disadvantages:** Higher complexity, requires architectural expertise

### Architectural Flow Analysis

#### Read Operation Flow (CQRS Query)
1. **UI Request**: Frontend sends GraphQL query via HTTP
2. **API Gateway**: Receives request, publishes query message to broker
3. **Message Routing**: Broker routes to appropriate backend instance
4. **Service Layer**: `CqrsService` receives message, looks up handler in request processor map
5. **Handler Resolution**: Dynamic routing to domain-specific CRUD handler
6. **Data Access**: Handler uses aggregate-specific data access layer
7. **Response**: Result flows back through same path with dedicated response topic

#### Write Operation Flow (CQRS Command + Event Sourcing)
1. **UI Command**: Frontend sends mutation via GraphQL
2. **API Gateway**: Publishes command to domain-specific topic
3. **Command Handler**: CRUD handler processes business logic
4. **Event Generation**: Handler creates domain events
5. **Event Store**: Events persisted via Event Sourcing service
6. **Event Processing**: ES handlers update materialized views
7. **Response**: Command result returned to caller

#### Dynamic Handler Registration
```javascript
// Domain layer exports processor maps
cqrsRequestProcessorMaps: Object.values(domains)
  .filter(domain => domain.cqrsRequestProcessorMap)
  .map(domain => domain.cqrsRequestProcessorMap)

// Service layer builds runtime routing map
joinCqrsRequestProcessMap() {
  return cqrsRequestProcessorMaps.reduce((acc, processorMap) => {
    Object.keys(processorMap).forEach(AggregateType => {
      Object.keys(processorMap[AggregateType]).forEach(MessageType => {
        acc[AggregateType][MessageType] = processorMap[AggregateType][MessageType];
      })
    })
    return acc;
  }, {});
}
```

## Compliance Analysis

### Hexagonal Architecture Compliance

#### ✅ **Excellent Compliance (95%)**

**What it follows:**
- **Clear Port Definition**: Well-defined interfaces between API gateways and backend
- **Adapter Implementation**: Multiple gateway adapters (EMI, External System, PIS) implement same domain interfaces
- **Business Logic Isolation**: Domain layer completely isolated from infrastructure concerns
- **Symmetric Design**: Equal treatment of incoming (API) and outgoing (database, messaging) adapters
- **Technology Independence**: Can switch from GraphQL to REST, MongoDB to PostgreSQL without domain changes

**Example - Port Definition:**
```javascript
// Port: Message handler interface
cqrsRequestProcessorMap: PaymentMediumCRUD.generateRequestProcessorMap()

// Adapter: API Gateway implementation  
"emigateway.graphql.query.PaymentMediumByMediumId": {
  fn: instance.getPaymentMediumByMediumId$,
  instance,
  jwtValidation: { roles: READ_ROLES }
}
```

**Minor Deviation:**
- Direct database access in domain aggregates (performance optimization)

### Clean Architecture Compliance

#### ⚠️ **Partial Compliance (70%)**

**✅ What it follows:**
- **Dependency Direction**: Infrastructure depends on domain, not vice versa
- **Entity Independence**: Domain models don't depend on frameworks
- **Use Case Layer**: Clear command/query handlers for business operations
- **Framework Independence**: Domain logic works without specific frameworks

**❌ What it doesn't follow:**
- **Data Access in Domain**: Aggregates contain their own data access logic
- **Performance Optimizations**: Native database queries bypass abstraction layers
- **Cached Objects**: Domain layer manages caching for performance

**🔄 Unique Adaptations:**
```javascript
// Domain layer with embedded data access for performance
class PaymentMediumCRUD {
  async getCachedPaymentMediumType$(id, organizationId) {
    let cached = this.cachedObjects[id];
    if (cached && (Date.now() - cached.__cacheTimestamp) < 300000) return cached;
    // Direct database access for performance
    cached = await PaymentMediumTypeDA.getPaymentMediumType$(id, organizationId).toPromise();
    return cached;
  }
}
```

**Compliance Score: 70%** - Intentional deviations for enterprise performance requirements

### Onion Architecture Compliance

#### ⚠️ **Good Compliance (80%)**

**✅ What it follows:**
- **Domain-Centric Design**: Business rules at the center of each aggregate
- **Dependency Inversion**: Outer layers depend on inner domain interfaces
- **Domain Service Layer**: Clear business logic separation
- **Infrastructure Isolation**: External systems in outer layer

**❌ What it doesn't follow:**
- **Pure Domain Model**: Some infrastructure concerns leak into domain
- **Repository Abstraction**: Direct data access patterns for performance

**🔄 Unique Adaptations:**
- **Per-Aggregate Data Access**: Each domain aggregate optimizes its own data access patterns
- **Performance-First Domain**: Business logic co-located with optimized data access

**Example - Domain Aggregate Structure:**
```
domain/payment-medium/
├── PaymentMediumCRUD.js      # Domain logic + commands/queries
├── PaymentMediumES.js        # Event sourcing domain logic  
├── data-access/              # Aggregate-specific optimization
│   ├── PaymentMediumDA.js    # Native MongoDB queries
│   └── PaymentMediumSeqDA.js # Sequence management
└── index.js                  # Aggregate interface
```

**Compliance Score: 80%** - Strong domain focus with performance pragmatism

### Microsoft® Application Architecture Guide Compliance

#### ✅ **Excellent Compliance (95%)**

**✅ What it follows:**
- **Microservice Architecture**: Well-defined service boundaries and responsibilities
- **CQRS Implementation**: Proper command/query separation with different models
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete event-driven state management
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear aggregate boundaries and domain modeling
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Comprehensive logging, security, and monitoring
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Multiple specialized gateways for different contexts
- **Message-Based Communication**: Asynchronous messaging between components

**Enterprise Patterns Implemented:**
```javascript
// CQRS with dynamic handler registration
const requestProcessMap = this.joinCqrsRequestProcessMap();

// Event Sourcing with projections
eventSourcing.emitEvent$(new Event({
  eventType: 'PreEmissionPrepared',
  aggregateType: 'PaymentMedium',
  aggregateId: paymentMedium.id,
  data: paymentMedium
}))

// Domain aggregate with business rules
class PaymentMediumCRUD {
  appliedRefundTrip$({ root, args, jwt }, authToken) {
    // Complex business rule validation
    if (now - lastCardScan > TWO_MINUTES_MS) {
      throw new CustomError('CardWasReadMoreThan2MinutesAgo', ...);
    }
  }
}
```
